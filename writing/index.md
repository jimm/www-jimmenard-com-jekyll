# Writing

Years ago I started writing
[<strong>Emacs Mastery</strong>: <em>Attaining Coding
Supremacy</em>](https://leanpub.com/emacs-mastery), though I'll probably
never complete it.
I'm considering making it freely available on the Web. Please vist the
book's Leanpub page, review the table of contents there, and
[let me know](mailto:jim@jimmenard.com) what else you think the book should
cover. Here is the introduction:

> Emacs is a master craftsman's tool. No, wait --- Emacs is an empty canvas,
> complete with brushes, paints (oil and acrylic), charcoal, scrapers,
> sponges, turpentine, and a nuclear-powered color wheel.
>
> Since I'm a musician and not a woodworker or painter, here's an analogy I
> can get behind: Emacs is a synthesizer. At first, you play the presets and
> have fun making music. You don't need all those knobs, but you do wonder
> what they're for. One day you're unhappy with the preset bass sound you're
> using --- it needs a sharper attack, a longer decay, and a brighter sound.
> You tweak a few knobs. They don't do what you want at first, but after a bit
> of reading the manual (ugh!) you start to understand what some of them do
> and you achieve that sound you were looking for.
>
> After reading more of the manual you begin to understand how the synth
> creates sounds and what's really going on when you turn those knobs. You
> start finding things that the synth can do that you never imagined it
> could. Not only that, getting the sounds you want is easier so you're
> spending less time tweaking knobs and more time making music.
>
> Meanwhile, you've come across terms like "subtractive synthesis",
> "wavetables", and "frequency modulation" so you start reading up on what
> those things mean. You're learning how sound synthesis works and that there
> are different ways of creating sounds. This knowledge helps you create new
> sounds and textures, opening up a universe of sound explosions you use to
> create mega-hit after mega-hit making you so mega-rich you mega-retire and
> give all your money to charity. A combination music/philanthropy prize is
> named after you and statues to you are erected everywhere.
>
> That's Emacs.
>
> I've been using Emacs since about 1982, and I still discover new things it
> can do or new ways to be more efficient. It may not be possible to know all
> there is to know about Emacs, but that's not the point. The point is to have
> a tool that helps me create what I want and be more efficient so I can
> create more. And knobs. Lots of knobs.

[<cite>Introduction to Ruby for Mac OS X</cite>](Intro_to_Ruby.html) was
originally published as the cover article in <cite>MacTech Magazine</cite>
19.3, March 2003.

<cite>Building Applications with Berkeley DB Java Edition</cite> appeared in
the September 2004 issue of the <cite>Java Developer's Journal</cite>.
Unfortunately, it's no longer available. I did find a copy of the article on
some other site, but it's not formatted correctly at all. See below for a
link to the code that accompanies the article.

<cite>Unit Testing with OCUnit</cite> was published on O'Reilly's
<cite>MacDevCenter</cite> on April 23, 2004. As with the previous article,
it's no longer avaiable. See below for a link to the code that accompanies
the article. The article was later picked up by OSNews. An update to the
article: the latest release of [TestKit](http://testkit.sourceforge.net/)
supports XCode.

Gotta link to my [blog](https://www.jimmenard.com/blog.html), though I don't
update it as often as I should.

[The Polyglot Programmer](complangs.html), a talk given to the
Connecticut CTO Club in March of 2012 and again at a Brown Bag Talk
at [ideeli](http://www.ideeli.com) the next month. These are raw
notes to myself, not a polished slide presentation.

The talk
[Ruby on Rails &ndash; An Introduction](rails_ctoclub/s5/index.html) was
given to the New York City CTO Club in July of 2006. _Hint:_ hover your
mouse over the lower right corner of the slides for a control panel.

The discusson/talk [Alternate Data Storage
Technologies](alternate_storage.html) was given to the New York City CTO Club on April 14, 2004.

<h2>Bride of Dark and Stormy</h2>

I entered a number of sentences into the
annual [Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest](http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/)
contest in 1998. Two of them were selected and published in <cite>Bride of
Dark and Stormy</cite>, compiled by Scott Rice.

> The alien stared at Captain Veronica Saunders with a warmth not unlike
> that found on certain of Pluto's outer moons, its black, scaly claws
> flexing in and out, in and out, its long powerful tail wrapped
> unmercifully around her curvaceous chest, pinning her arms to her sides,
> its two-hundred piggy little eyes peering into her very soul with a
> singularly steady gaze, and it found itself wishing in some dim portion of
> its tiny brain that this one wouldn't scream so much while being peeled.

That sentence was featured on the front page of a local California paper
the same year. Contest founder Scott Rice sent me a copy of the front page,
for which I am eternally grateful. I lost it, for which I am eternally pissed
off.

I had originally written "...wouldn't scream so much
_whilst_ being peeled," but it was changed to "while" in the book. I
prefer "whilst", but then I do tend to be a touch sesquipedalian.

The second entry:

> Firmly, almost indignantly, Thornton Entwhistle straightened his toupee
> and checked his lapels for stray specks of lint as he stood in front of
> the firmly closed mahogany door and again rehearsed his request for a
> legal pad all his own.
