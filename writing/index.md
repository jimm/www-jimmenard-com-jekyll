# Writing

Gotta link to my [blog](https://www.jimmenard.com/blog.html), though I don't
update it as often as I should.

I'm writing
[<strong>Emacs Mastery</strong>: <em>Attaining Coding Supremacy</em>](https://leanpub.com/emacs-mastery).
I'm considering making it freely available on the Web. Please vist the
book's Leanpub page, review the table of contents there, and
[let me know](mailto:jim@jimmenard.com) what else you think the book should
cover.

[The Polyglot Programmer](complangs.html), a talk given to the
Connecticut CTO Club in March of 2012 and again at a Brown Bag Talk
at [ideeli](http://www.ideeli.com) the next month. These are raw
notes to myself, not a polished slide presentation.

The talk
[Ruby on Rails &ndash; An Introduction](rails_ctoclub/s5/index.html) was
given to the New York City CTO Club in July of 2006. _Hint:_ hover your
mouse over the lower right corner of the slides for a control panel.

[<cite>Building Applications with Berkeley DB Java Edition</cite>](http://java.sys-con.com/node/46235)
appeared in the September 2004 issue of the
[Java Developer's Journal](http://java.sys-con.com/). See below for a link
to the code that accompanies the article.

[<cite>Unit
Testing with OCUnit</cite>](http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/04/23/ocunit.html)
was published on O'Reilly's [MacDevCenter](http://www.macdevcenter.com/) on April 23, 2004. See
below for a link to the code that accompanies the article. There are some
comments from readers at the end of the article. The article was picked up by
[OSNews](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=6823). An update
to the article: the latest release of [TestKit](http://testkit.sourceforge.net/) supports XCode.

The discusson/talk [Alternate Data Storage
Technologies](alternate_storage.html) was given to the New York City CTO Club on April 14, 2004.
(HTML only.)

[<cite>Introduction to Ruby for Mac OS
X</cite>](Intro_to_Ruby.html) was originally published as the cover article in <cite>MacTech
Magazine</cite> 19.3, March 2003.

A [Ruby talk](rubytalk/index.html) given to the New York City
CTO Club on July 10, 2001. (HTML and PDF available.)

My old blog <cite>Shiny Things</cite>
is [here](http://jimmenard.blogspot.com/). I've decided to move everything
directly onto this site's [blog](https://www.jimmenard.com/blog.html)
instead.

<h2>Bride of Dark and Stormy</h2>

I entered a number of sentences into the
annual [Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest](http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/)
contest in 1998. Two of them were selected and published in <cite>Bride of
Dark and Stormy</cite>, compiled by Scott Rice.

> The alien stared at Captain Veronica Saunders with a warmth not unlike
> that found on certain of Pluto's outer moons, its black, scaly claws
> flexing in and out, in and out, its long powerful tail wrapped
> unmercifully around her curvaceous chest, pinning her arms to her sides,
> its two-hundred piggy little eyes peering into her very soul with a
> singularly steady gaze, and it found itself wishing in some dim portion of
> its tiny brain that this one wouldn't scream so much while being peeled.

That sentence was featured on the front page of a local California paper
the same year. Contest founder Scott Rice sent me a copy of the front page,
for which I am eternally grateful. I lost it, for which I am eternally pissed
off.

I had originally written "...wouldn't scream so much
_whilst_ being peeled," but it was changed to "while" in the book. I
prefer "whilst", but then I do tend to be a touch sesquipedalian.

The second entry:

> Firmly, almost indignantly, Thornton Entwhistle straightened his toupee
> and checked his lapels for stray specks of lint as he stood in front of
> the firmly closed mahogany door and again rehearsed his request for a
> legal pad all his own.
