Ruby on Rails -- Is it Hot, or Is it Not?

With all the buzz about Ruby on Rails, it's time to take a closer look. July's
talk will introduce you to Ruby on Rails. We will talk about its design
philosophy and architecture. We will see what Rails gives you out of the box
and what it doesn't, and mention some of the add-ons that are available. Other
topics will include integration with your existing systems, how Rails apps are
developed, tested, and deployed, and how Rails apps handle scaling.
