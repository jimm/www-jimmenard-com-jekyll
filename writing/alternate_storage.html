<h1>Justification</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>"As far as I've seen, once those XML worms eat into your brain, it's hard
to ever get anything practical done again. To an XML person, every nail looks
like a thumb. Or something like that."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; fejj on advogato.org</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Know your options and your tools.</p>

<p>Update: Astute reader <a href="mailto:cjs@cynic.net">Curt Sampson</a>
points out, "[T]he relational model is in no way a data <em>storage</em>
technique, but is a data <em>modelling</em> technique. It's entirely
orthogonal to something such as in-memory storage versus disk storage, for
both relational and non-relational models, you have the choice of in-memory or
not-in-memory storage."</p>

<p>Curt is, of course, entirely correct. I mean the term "data storage" not in
its technical sense but in the sense of a broad approach to modeling, storing,
and retrieving data. The talk was given to a room full of CTOs and
senior-level technology managers, not database architects. I opened with an
informal introduction that hopefully explained what I meant.</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>

<p>All <b>emphasis</b> is mine and is used purely to draw your eye to the
interesting bits.</p>

<h3>Success</h3>

<p>&quot;For the past 5 years or so, the project I work on has been using an
Object-Oriented database (Versant, storing Java objects). By all accounts,
it has been a <b>success for us</b>. We are now looking at moving to JDO,
keeping Versant as a choice, but being able to profile and have other database
choices in deployment. JDO is very similar to the proprietary J/VI interface
we have been using, but there are some slight differences.&quot;</p>

<h3>Sotheby's</h3>

<p>ODI's ObjectStore was in use at Sotheby's before the auction site was
built. The original auction site code used ObjectStore. The numbers showed
that <b>reads were much faster than writes</b>, though that was not the major
factor in deciding not to use the system developed around it. Another problem
was the need to write <b>custom code for every query</b>. Reporting was very
difficult; there were no good tools back in '99 (though there may be now).
ObjectStore is <b>still in use</b> at Sotheby's for other purposes.</p>

<h3>Fast</h3>

<p>Dan Woods used ODI at Time, Inc. They had a few problems and had to
dump and reload the database. It was blazingly fast.</p>

<h3>Fear</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LetsUseAnObjectOrientedDatabase">Let's
Use an Object Oriented Database</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Yesterday I was in the audience for a presentation given by a Content
Management System vendor. They were very pleased of their model for content,
<b>object this and meta that</b> and inheritance the other. And it <b>runs
over Oracle</b>. Up goes my paw: why not use an OODBMS? Chuckles all round and
there came out the story of another content management outfit who did <b>use
an OODBMS, and have nearly gone bust since very few customers were prepared to
have the thing</b> in the building. Even for web content, not legacy data,
people won't touch an OODBMS. Astounding.&quot; &ndash; Keith Braithwaite.</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell is everyone so afraid of? GemStone has <b>saved me lots
of development work</b>. GemStone has <b>saved me lots of response time</b>. I
intend to continue using it for <b>competitive advantage</b> over those who
insist on doing it the hard way.&quot; &ndash; Randy Stafford</p>

<h3>Order of magnitude gain</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LetsUseAnObjectOrientedDatabase">Let's
Use an Object Oriented Database</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;I just wrote a GemStonej application that can switch between object
persistence and relational persistence at runtime, based on a property read at
startup. At present I'm seeing <b>an order of magnitude difference</b> in
response time between the two persistence modes (object persistence being
faster, of course) - and this says nothing of the <b>extra development
effort</b> you have to go through <b>to do O/R mapping</b>. But in fairness we
have more optimization to do on the relational side. And for a simpler domain
model than we have, relational persistence may be OK.&quot; &ndash; Randy
Stafford</p>

<h3>Experiences</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LetsUseAnObjectOrientedDatabase">Let's
Use an Object Oriented Database</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;My empirical touchstone here was a comparison we conducted at AC
Nielsen in 1996. We tried every OODB on the market then, about a dozen
including, I seem to recall, Gemstone. We found similar performance
constraints on all. Regular OS paging mechanisms just couldn't keep up with
the specialized disk access techniques of the RDBMSes.&quot; &ndash; Peter
Merel</p>

<p>&quot;My experience is that while GemStonej is <b>typically faster</b> than
an RDBMS and more flexible, the <b>work required</b> to "roll your own"
indexing, searching &amp; querying framework can be <b>complex for some
developers</b> not accustomed to dealing with the performance problems of
dealing with thousands to millions of objects.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;I think this comes to the abstraction principle: an <b>RDBMS is a
black box</b> with a big label on it that says: "This is REALITY. :thud of SQL
manual falling on desk: You must think inside of this box." An <b>OODBMS says:
"Here's a set of minimal rules</b>. Now you can create the rest of your own
reality."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;My opinion: In application areas where it pays to "think outside of
the box", an OODBMS is the proper choice, assuming you work with people that
can handle the power properly&quot; &ndash; Stu Charlton</p>

<p>&quot;<b>Efficiently traversing relationships</b>: Relational databases
don't do this well because it's hard to arrange locality of storage. If I read
an employee, then his department, then his office, etc, etc... I'm going to
have to return to the database several times. Object databases, on the other
hand, let you cluster related data together, enabling you to traverse
relationships more efficiently.</p>

<p>&quot;So what? Well, the GemStone application I worked on was a case
management system. It's never going to be used to grind over tables and
generate reports. The only thing anybody ever does with it is traverse object
relationships. I seriously doubt that it would have worked even half as well
with a relational database behind it.&quot; &ndash; Anthony Lander</p>

<h1>Object-Relational Mapping</h1>

<ul>
<li>Rationale: much current development is object oriented, much data storage
  is relational</li>
<li>Impedance mismatch
  <ul>
  <li>Object identities are not the same as primary keys</li>
  <li>Inheritance hierarchies don't map naturally (especially multiple
    inheritance, mixins, or interfaces)</li>
  <li>Foreign keys can only reference one table; how store a contained object
    that implements some interface? What if my <code>Container</code> can
    store <code>Things</code>, where <code>Thing</code> is an interface
    implemented by <code>Widget</code>, <code>Gadget</code>, and
    <code>Customer</code>?</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>It takes time and money to map</li>
<li>Frameworks (language-specific)
  <ul>
  <li>Java: <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>,
    <a href="http://objectstyle.org/cayenne/index.html">Cayenne</a>,
    <a href="http://db.apache.org/torque/">Torque</a>,
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdo/index.jsp">JDO</a></li>
  <li>Ruby: <a href="http://lafcadio.rubyforge.org/">Lafcadio</a>,
    <a href="http://www.starware.one.pl/software/sds/index.html">SDS</a></li>
  </ul></li>
<li>Hide SQL differences between databases</li>
<li>Some tools support different approaches at the same time:
  <ul>
  <li>Write mapping, generate SQL and code</li>
  <li>Reverse-engineer database, creating mapping and code</li>
  <li>Write code&mdash;perhaps with XDoclet hints&mdash; and generate mapping 
  and SQL</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>If language supports reflection or runtime manipulation, framework can
  hide some of the details that make persistence more transparent</li>
<li>Can take care of a lot of busy work like deleting object trees</li>
<li>Even a home-grown O/R framework can help a team
  <ul>
  <li>Cleans up the code; JDBC code not scattered everywhere</li>
  <li>Uses design patterns</li>
  <li>Enforces single place to look for SQL</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>Does not always generate the best SQL for a particular query</li>
<li>Can turn relationships expressed awkwardly in RDBMS (many-to-many, for
  example artists and galleries) into natural OO relationships (each side has
  list of objects)</li>
<li>Often, mapping is stored as XML or other human-readable format or is even
  stored in the code itself</li>
<li>Some frameworks let you pre-fetch related objects</li>
<li>ROE: Smalltalk code turned in to SQL</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to use</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you use objects and must store objects in a RDBMS</li>
<li>When you want to save time and effort performing the mapping</li>
</ul>

<h2>When not to use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Need to tweak SQL a lot (not just in one place)
  <ul>
  <li>Frameworks usually let you write raw SQL</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Stories</h2>

<p>All <b>emphasis</b> is mine and is used purely to draw your eye to the
interesting bits.</p>

<h3>Caching</h3>

<p>Daniel Seltzer worked on a high-load Oracle installation where they could
not interject an O/R mapping. He introduced the <code>util.concurrent</code>
classes by Doug Lee. The cache manager uses a lookup key for each object. One
cache per JVM. He had tools to monitor the cache's performance.</p>

<p>Objects expired by time. This was simpler than anything else. They slightly
randomized the time so that everything didn't expire at the same time.</p>

<h3>Cayenne</h3>

<p>I chose Cayenne for the Preclick PhotoWiki, replacing a custom O/R mapping
layer. This <b>cleaned up the code</b> and made it much <b>simpler to
modify</b>. It also removed lots of code from the application that worried
about the persistence state of objects.</p>

<p>Cayenne performs object caching at three levels (all optional): between
data contexts (essentially database connections), within a single JVM, and
between JVMs.</p>

<p>Cayenne <b>couldn't handle a few tricky relationships</b>. I found a few
bugs in Cayenne having to do with foreign keys that were almost immediately
fixed by the developer. The community was quite helpful, even if the answer
was, "We can't do that yet. Here's a quick workaround."</p>

<p>Cayenne comes with a good GUI design tool that lets you reverse engineer a
database, create one from scratch, generate the Java code, generate the SQL
for the database, and generate the database itself.</p>

<p>There are still some meaningless coding and design requirements (from
object's point of view), like having to specify reverse relationships.</p>

<p>Cayenne is also used on the <a href="http://www.nhl.com/">NHL's
site</a>.</p>

<h1>In-Memory Databases</h1>

<ul>
<li>Historically, memory was scarce</li>
<li>Cache some data in memory; why not all?</li>

<li>Not new</li>
<li>Many relational databases pull tables into memory</li>

<li><a href="http://www.prevayler.org">Prevayler</a> getting the most press;
  we'll concentrate on that (and ignore the project owners' haughty

  been used by a few of our members</li>
</ul>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<ul>
<li>All objects in memory all the time</li>
<li>All (Prevayler) operations implemented as serializable command</li>
<li>Unlike OO and relational databases, prevalence layer doesn't know about
  internals of system (classes, tables, objects)</li>
<li>Fast: Prevayler claims queries are 3,000 - 9,000 faster than
  MySQL/Oracle, even when fully cached in RAM and on the same machine
  <ul>
  <li>No SQL to build</li>
  <li>No SQL to run</li>

<h3>Who uses it?</h3>

<p>It took me a <b>while to find</b> links to <b>users</b> on the Prevayler
site to <a
href="http://www.prevayler.org/wiki.jsp?topic=PrevaylerPioneers">Prevayler
pioneers</a> and <a
href="http://www.prevayler.org/wiki.jsp?topic=MajorCompaniesUsingPrevalence">Major
companies using Prevayler</a>. The latter list is short: Lehman Brothers,
Microsoft (Ensemble Studios game company), Blizzard Entertainment,
Petrobr&aacute;s (Brazil's largest oil company), Vivo (large Brazilian cell
phone operator), and TV Record (third largest TV network in Brazil).</p>

<h3>Too good to be true?</h3>

<p>Jon Tirsen <a
href="http://www.jroller.com/page/tirsen/20030113#a_href_http_www_neward">wrote</a>:
&quot;The morning after (I stumbled in late and hungover actually) my
pair-programming mate had read all about it at the Prevayler site I left open
in the browser and already ript[sic] out our then OJB-persistence layer and
replaced it with Prevayler. Later that day we experienced the <b>sensational
10k performance gain</b> and we're probably <b>never going back again</b>.
(Remember our system was very performant[sic] from the start.)&quot;</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>

<h3>Speedier Terabytes</h3>

<p>&quot;One of my last employers, XXXX, may have a story for you. Their
background &ndash; a database marketing agency who provides direct mail and
email leads to catalogers, telemarketers, mailers, or any marketing
organization... Their <b>database was huge</b> &ndash; several terabytes. It
was comprised of Experian's Gold File and several other consumer files,
equally[sic] two hundred million consumer records.</p>

<p>&quot;Originally the data was stored in relational tables. However,
generating counts was a lengthy process in terms of time and computing
resources. A decision was made to transform the database into <b>one huge
flat file</b> (yep, start gasping for air) and <b>index it</b> using a product
called Omnidex. Then a custom app was developed to generated counts and voila,
we had a faster, more reliable and cheaper to operate database.</p>

<p>&quot;I had come into the scene after the conversion had occurred. Being
used to large scale ERP and DW implementations, I flipped when I heard what
was happening. The CIO was able to convince me on the <b>performance gains</b>
they made under the arrangement. It works. Furthermore, there was no negative
impact on other data processing, such as ETL (we used Ab Initio).&quot;</p>

<h3>Ad Campaign Data</h3>

<p>Steve Jacobs wrote: &quot;At Poindexter we have built our ad server without
a traditional database. We were a small scrappy company for a while with
limited resources and the <b>cost of scaling a database infrastructure</b> to
support billions of ads served per month <b>was prohibitive</b>. There are 3
areas where a database is needed: data on what ads are in an advertiser's
campaign, data we've gathered about the user (what ads they've seen, for
example) and reporting data about what ads have been shown.</p>

<p>&quot;For campaign data we take snapshots of the Oracle database that our
web based campaign management tool connects to and push the most recent
changes to the ad servers. This used to be in the form of XSL documents that
encoded both the data and the targeting required for the campaign. The user
data was a XML document stored in the users cookie. <b>Serving an ad</b> was
simply by <b>performing a transformation</b> on the XML cookie. When an ad was
chosen, the reporting information was written out to flat files. These flat
files would then be loaded into an Oracle database on a nightly basis for
reporting purposes.</p>

<p>&quot;Eventually the <b>cost of doing the transformation with the
style sheets became prohibitive</b> &ndash; we just couldn't get transactions
per second we needed with XML/XSL. We've since <b>migrated</b> to actual
<b>Java code generation</b> to replace the XSL where the Java code reads the
users cookie. The cookie itself is no longer in XML either; we've switched to
a <b>proprietary format</b> that is <b>faster to parse</b> for use by the Java
code. When I first suggested to my architect that we generate Java code rather
than XSL I prefaced it by saying, 'I can't believe I'm about to suggest this,
but...' Nonetheless, it's worked out well, giving us a 3x performance
improvement overall.</p>

<p>&quot;I <b>don't like the fact that we've mixed data and code together in
one big stew</b>. The benefit is that there's no parsing XML trees or the like
&ndash; the data is all there built in to the code. The drawback is that
changes to the code may end up meaning we have to regenerate the code/data for
all campaigns.&quot;</p>

<h3>Because It's There</h3>

<p>Daniel Seltzer was on a project at a non-profit organization a few years
ago. They lacked the development process, system admin, and money for
traditional IT services. They ended up using the file system as the data
store. Daniel developed a publishing tool in Ant. There was a small amount of
metadata in a database. An Ant task periodically synched the database with
the file system.</p>

<p>They indexed the text with Lucene.</p>

<h3>Sync Sort</h3>

<p>Mark Uhrmacher has used <a
href="http://www.syncsort.com/sort/info.htm">SyncSort</a> (I'm checking the
URL) on flat files with billions of transactions.</p>

<h1>ISAM</h1>

<ul>
<li>Indexed Sequential Access Method; from IBM</li>
<li>Data stored sequentially; separate index eases random access</li>
<li>Multiple indices for multiple orderings.</li>
<li>Orthogonal to relational storage; relational can be implemented using
ISAM</li>
</ul>

<p>The xBASE family of databases are structured similar to ISAM, with data
files and index files. Applications read the files directly.</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>

<p>&quot;When adding records with ascending adjacent keys, the add process
would get slower and slower because overflow records were kept in an unblocked
linked list and the next record had to be added to the end of the list.</p>

<p>&quot;As a system programmer, I was called about twice a year because 'the
computer is running slow'.  The fix is to add the records in descending key
sequence so each record is added at the head of the linked list.  It was fun
at first being hailed as a genius. But as Yogi Berra said, it was deja vu all
over again.&quot;</p>
