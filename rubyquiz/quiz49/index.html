<!--#include virtual="/header.html"-->

<p>Here is my solution to Ruby Quiz 49: <a
href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz49.html">Lisp Game</a>. It consists of two
parts: the game engine and a game description. I've called it "RADS" in homage
to the <a href="http://www.tads.org/">TADS</a> interactive fiction engine. In
the quiz description, James mentioned that you could take at least two
approaches: mimic the Lisp or do it the "Ruby way". I've attempted to do the
latter.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="rads.rb">rads.rb</a> the engine</li>
<li><a href="game.rb">game.rb</a> the game description and custom verbs</li>
</ul>

<p>To run this game, download both files and execute game.rb.</p>


<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Game engine</h3>

<ul>

<li>Accepts inventory or i</li>

<li>Accepts look or l, also accepts "look at x"</li>

<li>Accepts examine or x, which prints a long description</li>

<li>"it" represents the last-examined, taken, or dropped object. You can take
it, examine it, look at it</li>

<li>Short direction names (n, s, e, w, u, d)</li>

<li>Accepts walk or go</li>

<li>Short direction names are also verbs so you can just type "w" to go
west</li>

<li>Altername names for things ("whiskey bottle", "bottle", "whiskey")</li>

<li>Decorations, which are objects that can't be taken. Try "x wizard" or
"look at couch".</li>

<li>A decoration without a short_desc won't be output as part of the room's
description. You can examine the couch, but it won't be described separately
because it's already part of the wizard's long description.</li>

<li>Game-specific verbs are defined in the game file, not in the engine</li>

<li>Any object with no "names" array defined in the initialization proc will
have one created for it containing the short_desc</li>

<li>Containment (things within other things) is implemented and contents of
containers like the bucket will be printed, but "put in"/"take out" is not yet
implemented.</li>

</ul>



<p>To do:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fix the fact that you can't examine the door in the garden</li>

<li>Implement "put in"/"take out".</li>

<li>Write a "put x in y" verb</li>

<li>Understand prepositions. In addition to "splash bucket [on] wizard" and
"dunk bucket [in] well", I'd like to allow "splash wizard with bucket".</p>

</ul>

<h3>Game file</h3>

<ul>

<li>Game-specific verbs are defined here, not as part of the RADS library</li>

<li>The dunk, weld, and splash verbs take (but ignore) prepositions. Try
"splash bucket on wizard" or "splash bucket wizard".</li>

</ul>
