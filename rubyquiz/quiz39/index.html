<p>Here is my solution to Ruby Quiz 39: <a
href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz39.html">Sampling</a>. This solution, which
takes roughly 1.75 minutes to run realtime (0.010 sec user time) is so short,
I present it here in its entirety:</p>

<pre class="code">
#! /usr/bin/env ruby

require 'set'

def sample(members, range)
  selected = Set.new
  members.times {
    val = rand(range)
    val = rand(range) until selected.add?(val)
  }
  selected.to_a.sort
end

puts sample(ARGV[0].to_i, ARGV[1].to_i).join("\n")
</pre>

<p>This solution is completely out-of-the-box. I played with a few
optimizations, without looking for this algorithm anywhere online. Instead of
using a Set (which is backed by a Hash), I wanted to create a
<code><i>range</i></code>-length array and mark each selected value using that
array. With a range of 10e9, my machine ran out of memory.</p>

<p>Disk I/O took about 45 seconds of the total time. There's probably a way to
speed that up.</p>
