Here's a bunch of big news from cloud computing application framework
company [10gen](http://www.10gen.com/): their SDK is now
[available for download](http://www.10gen.com/blog/2008/7/10gen-platform-sdk-available),
they are making the entire platform
[Open Source](http://www.10gen.com/blog/2008/7/10gen-platform-is-open-source),
and they've received
[Series A financing](http://www.10gen.com/blog/2008/7/financing).
Congratulations to 10gen for reaching these big milestones, and for the
decision to make their code Open Source.

In related news, I'm joining 10gen as of August 11th. I can't wait to start.
I'm hoping to be able to blog about what I'll be working on: improving their
Ruby implementation and making Ruby on Rails work on their cloud computing
platform with Mongo, the 10gen distributed OO database.
