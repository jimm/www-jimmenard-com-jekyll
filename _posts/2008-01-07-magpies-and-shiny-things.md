Over at [Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) Jeff Atwood just
posted
[The Magpie Developer](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000916.html).
As somebody with a blog named "Shiny Things", I'm well aware of my penchant
for new technologies. Recently, it's been
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Erlang](http://erlang.org/).

The wise magpie doesn't throw away his old shiny things. He takes what he
learns from new technologies and tries to apply them to what he's using now.
