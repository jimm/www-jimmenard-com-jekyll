I'll be giving the talk "Ruby In the Cloud" at RubyConf 2008 in November.
For a poorly-formatted outline, see
[http://rubyconf.org/talks/20](http://rubyconf.org/talks/20).

Geir Magnusson Jr and I gave a preliminary version of this talk last week to
the [nycruby](http://nycruby.org/wiki/), the NYC Ruby Users' Group. Thanks
to everyone who attended for all their questions and suggestions.
