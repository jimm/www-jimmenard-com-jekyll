[10gen](http://www.10gen.com) has announced that it is
[Shifting Emphasis to the Database](http://www.10gen.com/blog/2009/1/shifting-emphasis-to-the-database).
They decided to focus on the [Mongo database](http://www.mongodb.org/) after
finding that there was much more interest in it than in their Babble cloud
computing app server.

Babble is still alive, though. It has a
[new web site](http://www.babbleapp.org/) and has shifted to the Apache
license.

This may all be good news for 10gen, but it's bad news for me. Since I was
working on bringing Ruby and Rails to Babble, I and a number of other fine
engineers at 10gen have been let go. It hurts, but I've had a blast and
learned a lot at 10gen.

For the next few weeks, I'm going to be finishing up work on the Ruby Mongo
driver, MongoRecord (an ActiveRecord-like framework for Mongo that is
independent of Rails), and Rails ActiveRecord support for Mongo.

Oh, yeah: here's my
[resume](http://www.io.com/~jimm/Jim_Menard_resume.html).
