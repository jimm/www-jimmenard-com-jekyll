I've always wanted to learn to use [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/). My
first two attempts are
[Mosquito Byte Rag](http://www.jimmenard.com/music/mosquito_bite_rag.pdf)
[link fixed] (PDF, 148K) and a piano version of the
[Equal Rites Main Theme](http://www.jimmenard.com/music/main_theme_piano.pdf)
(PDF, 117K). There are no dynamic or note markings yet.

I wrote Mosquito Bite Rag thirty years ago. _Thirty. Years. Ago._ That makes
me feel old, but what's worse is that I haven't written anything seriously
in over ten years. Even the Equal Rites theme is around fifteen years old.
