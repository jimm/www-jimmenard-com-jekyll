title: Gmail Adds "Delete" Keyboard Shortcut
tags: email, google
---

Today my GMail account was upgraded to the new interface. The contacts
management interface has been improved, but that's not what I'm excited
about.

On a whim, I decided to review the keyboard shortcuts found at
http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6594. Guess what? Google
has added `#` as a keyboard shortcut for "delete". YAY! They've also added a
bunch of other keyboard shortcuts I haven't seen before: mark as (un)read,
archive and previous/next, and undo.

As a die-hard keyboarder, the lack of a "delete" shortcut has been most
annoying. I've been waiting for this ever since GMail launched.

Thanks, Google.
