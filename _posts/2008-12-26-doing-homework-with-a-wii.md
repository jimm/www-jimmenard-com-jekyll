title: Doing Homework With a Wii

My younger daughter just said to me, "Dad, I know how to cheat at homework
with the Wii." I asked what whe meant. She said that if you had to
alphabetize a list of words (which she sometimes does for homework), you
could create a Mii (an in-game avatar on the Wii) for each word, and give it
that word as the name. Then use the game's "sort by name" feature to display
all the Miis in alphabetical order. Voila!

I'm so proud of her.
