Two [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/)-related notes, neither about the
language /per se/. First, take a look at
["Why do you like Erlang?"](http://www.clickcaster.com/channel/item/why-do-you-like-erlang).
I love the Magic card. The article's good, too.

Second, my Erlang blog entries for June were selected as that month's
contest winners by Pay Eyler of [On Erlang](http://on-erlang.blogspot.com/),
[PragDave Thomas](http://pragdave.pragprog.com/), and
[Joe Armstrong](http://armstrongonsoftware.blogspot.com/). Thanks to all of
them for the honor. There has been no official announcement (and there might
not be), but my copy of
[Programming Erlang](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/index.html)
is on its way now that the paper edition is shipping. I've had my PDF
version for quite a while, and I highly recommend the book.
