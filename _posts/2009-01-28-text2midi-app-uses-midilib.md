Gabriel G has released [text2midi](http://text2midi.herokugarden.com), a
Rails app that converts&mdash;wait for it&mdash;text that you paste into the
Web page to MIDI, and plays it for you and lets you download the MIDI.

text2midi uses [midilib](http://midilib.rubyforge.org/), my Ruby MIDI
manipulation library.

Go, Gabriel!
