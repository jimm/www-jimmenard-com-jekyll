[Firebug](http://www.getfirebug.com/) is an incredibly useful Firefox
extension for developers. You can debug JavaScript, edit HTML and CSS,
inspect the DOM, determine the download times of all of the elements on a
page, inspect headers, and much more.

Firebug 1.0 beta has just been released. I can't say enough good things
about this extension. If you are a Web developer, it really should be part
of your tool set.
