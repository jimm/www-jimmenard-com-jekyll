<h1> Jim has a social life! (Just kidding. He has a daughter, though.) </h1>

<p> I am Claire, Jim's daughter. (I feel fancy calling my dad by his first
  name!) Currently, he is trying to teach me to program stuff. So, this is
  me showing you that I am actually learning things! Horray for nerdy
  fathers! </p>
