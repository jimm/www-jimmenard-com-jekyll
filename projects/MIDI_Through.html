<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
<strong>MIDI Through</strong> does what it says. It connects your BeOS
computer's MIDI outputs to its MIDI inputs and to the internal MIDI synth.
You can turn off or on the connections between each MIDI input and output.
By default, all inputs are connected to all outputs and to the MIDI synth.
</p>

<p>
To turn the connection between a MIDI input and a MIDI output on or off,
click the corresponding check box. The current port connection settings
are saved whenever you quit <strong>MIDI Through</strong>
</p>

<p>
The panic button sends all-notes-off messages on all MIDI channels to
all MIDI output ports. Even if a MIDI output is not connected to any
MIDI inputs, the all-notes-off message is still sent to that output.
</p>



<!-- // Internal MIDI Synth Window -->
<h1>Internal MIDI Synth Window</h1>

<p>
The Internal Synth window displays a program name popup menu and
a volume slider for each MIDI channel. You can select programs and
adjust the volume of each channel.
</p>

<p>
When you send a MIDI program change or volume command, the corresponding
popup menu or slider is updated.
</p>

<p>
The General MIDI spec defines channel 10 as the drum channel. At first
glance it may seem unnecessary to provide a program change popup menu
for channel 10.
However, not all synths are General MIDI and many treat channel 10 the
same as any other MIDI channel.
</p>



<!-- // Application Menu -->
<h1>Application Menu</h1>

<p>
The application menu appears in all <strong>MIDI Through</strong> windows.
It contains items that let you display an incredibly
boring About Box, open this online help, and quit the application.
</p>

<p>
The current port connection settings are saved whenever you quit
<strong>MIDI Through</strong>.
</p>



<!-- // MIDI Menu -->

<p>
The <strong>MIDI</strong> menu's single item, Panic, does the same thing
the Panic button in the main window does. The keyboard shortcut for this
command is <tt>Alt-Space</tt>.

<!-- // Notes -->
<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>Changes in this latest revision:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Remember and restore the two windows' positions.
		Thanks to Jon Watte for his libprefs library.</li>
	<li>The application menu (to the left of the MIDI menu) now displays
		the application icon.</li>
	<li>The BeOS internal MIDI synth is initialized in a separate thread.
		What does this mean to you? Quicker startup times.</li>
</ul>

<p> When playing the internal MIDI synth, there is a horrible
delay. Jon Watte says, &quot;The culprit is the Audio Kit. It has a minimum
latency of one buffer, which is about 25 ms; typically you'll see latencies
two or three times that number. This is a function of the BeBox hardware,
and there's nothing you can do about it&quot;</p>

<p>
The number of MIDI in and out ports that <strong>MIDI Through</strong> handles
is currently fixed. There is no way for the program to find out how many
MIDI in and out ports your computer has.
</p>

<p>
I can't figure out how to get an application to exclusively launch,
<em>i.e.</em>, only launch one copy even if you double-click its icon
more than once. So...don't do that!
</p>

<p>
I <em>hate</em> the pseudo-word "thru."
