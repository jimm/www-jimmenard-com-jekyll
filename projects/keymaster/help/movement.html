			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			</a> Moving from <a href="patches.html#Patches">patch</a> to patch
			is what <strong>KeyMaster</strong> is all about. Patches configure
			your MIDI setup and modify the MIDI data. Moving between patches changes
			your system's configuration.
			<p> The name of the <em>current patch</em> is displayed in the <a
href="windows.html#Document">Document window</a>. It is the patch that is modifying
				MIDI data.
			<p> You can move from <a href="components.html#Song">song</a> to song
				and from <a
href="components.html#Chain">chain</a> to chain, as well. When you move to a song,
				the first patch in the song becomes the current patch. When you
				move to a chain, the first song in the chain becomes the current
				song (and its patch becomes the current patch).
			<p> You can move forward to the next patch or backward to the previous
				patch. You can also jump forward to the last patch in a song or
				backward to the first patch in a song. Moving forward beyond the
				last patch in a song moves to the first patch of the next song
				<em>in the current chain</em>, and moving backward from the first
				patch in a song moves to the last patch of the previous song in
				the current chain.
			<p> Opening a patch edit window does not make that patch the current
				patch.
			<p> Moving to a chain, song, or patch makes it the <em>current</em>
				or <em>active</em> chain, song, or patch. When a chain becomes
				active, the first song is also made active. When a song is made
				active, its first patch is made active. Nothing visible happens,
				except that the main Document window is updated with the names
				of the current chain, song, and patch.
			<p>
			<hr>
			<a name="KeyMouse">
			<h1>Moving via the Keyboard and Mouse</h1>
			</a> To move from chain to chain, song to song, or patch to patch,
			you can
			<ul>
				<li>Use the <a href="main_menu.html#MainMenu">movement menu items</a>
					or their keyboard shortcuts,</li>
				<li>Click on the movement buttons in the <a
href="windows.html#Document">Document window</a>,</li>
				<li>Drag a chain, song, or patch into the corresponding text field
					in the Document window,</li>
				<li>Type a chain, song, or patch name into the corresponding text
					field in the Document window,</li>
				<li>Send one of the MIDI messages for the <a href="#MoveTrig">Movement
					Triggers</a> you have defined, or</li>
				<li>Send a program change from a specific MIDI instrument defined,
					again, in the Movement Triggers window.</li>
			</ul>
			To jump directly to a particular chain, song, or patch, you can
			<ul>
				<li>Open the <a href="windows.html#Find">Find window</a>, select
					the type in the popup menu, enter a name (*), and click "Goto",</li>
				<li>Type a name in the corresponding Document window text box,</li>
				<li>Press a <a href="#ProgGotos">Programmable Goto Key</a>, or</li>
				<li>Drag a song/chain/patch into the corresponding Document window
					text box. </li>
			</ul>
			(*) When you type a name into the Find window or one of the Document
			window text boxes, remember that (a) you can type any unique name
			prefix, and (b) case doesn't matter.
			<p>
			<hr>
			<a name="MoveTrig">
			<h1>Move Triggers</h1>
			</a> You can use MIDI data to move around, too. The Movement Trigger
			specifies two different ways to move. Both ways listen to specific
			MIDI channels coming from an instrument.
			<p> First, you can specify MIDI controllers that signal when to move
				to the next or previous patch. For example, you can tell <strong>KeyMaster</strong>
				to move to the next patch when it receives controller 23 from
				your DX-7, and to move to the next song when it receives controller
				24 from MIDI channels 3 or 4 sent by your Wavestation.
			<p> Some MIDI controllers are continuous (<i>i.e.</i>, send out all
				values from 0 to 127), and some are discrete (send out only 0
				and 127). Move Triggers always activate when they receive a value
				of 127.
			<p> The second kind of movement trigger is a program change. Any program
				change message that is sent from the instrument you specify is
				used to move to the next or previous patch. There are four modes:
			<p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Advance to next patch</dt>
				<dd>Move to the next patch when any program change is received.</dd>
				<dt>Higher to next, lower to previous</dt>
				<dd>Move to the next patch when the program change number is larger
					than the previous one, or move to the previous patch when
					it is smaller. The first program change you send always moves
					forward, since <strong>KeyMaster</strong> doesn't know what
					the previous program change number was.</dd>
				<dt>Jump to song</dt>
				<dd>Jump to the beginning of the <var>nth</var> song in the master
					song list, where <var>n</var> is the program change number.</dd>
				<dt>Do nothing</dt>
				<dd>Don't move as a result of any program change.</dd>
			</dl>
			Use the <a href="windows.html#MoveTrig">Move Trigger window</a> to
			specify the MIDI controllers you use to move, and the program change
			instrument and MIDI channel.
			<p>
			<hr>
			<a name="ProgGotos">
			<h1>Programmable Goto Keys</h1>
			</a> <strong>PROGRAMMABLE GOTO KEYS ARE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.</strong>
			<p> Jump to a song and patch with a single key stroke. You can assign
				a patch to any of the function keys. Pressing that key makes the
				assigned patch the current patch.
			<p> <em>Will have a drag-and-drop editor window. User can drag patches
				onto keys.</em>
