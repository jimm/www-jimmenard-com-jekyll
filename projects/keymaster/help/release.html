			<h1>Release Notes</h1>
			This help is <em>slowly</em> shaping up. It was originally written
			for an earlier version of <strong>KeyMaster</strong>.
			<p> Some editor windows are still very primitive. For example, most
				MIDI data (except for note names and controller numbers) can only
				be entered by typing in a number. Even worse, these values can
				only be entered in decimal and not in hex or binary. Some MIDI data
				fields respond to incoming MIDI, though.
			<p> I haven't yet done any MIDI stress testing to see if large, complex
				patches slow down the MIDI data any.
			<p> Large chunks of functionality don't exist yet:
			<ul>
				<li>Move Triggers</li>
				<li>Program Change number substitution</li>
				<li>Sysex Librarian</li>
				<li>Program Change names</li>
				<li>Programmable Goto Keys</li>
				<li>Any of the new features described on the
				<a href="http://www.jimmenard.com/keymaster/index.html">KeyMaster
				Web page</a></li>
			<p> KeyMaster uses Jon Watte's libprefs library.
			</ul>
			<h4>Known Bugs</h4>
			<p>This is a list of some of the known bugs. I'm working on 'em.
			<ul>
<li>38 - Implement undo. Everywhere. (Easier said than done.)

<li>120 - HelpPopUps don't always go to the right spot.

<li>129 - ZEListView doesn't know how to paste itself. ZoneEditor also has PASTE
	menu item commented out.

<li>138 - Delete output from patch 0, then save and quit. Will blow up in
	~MIDI_IO() part of ~MIDIInput(). (Is this MIDI_IO related or just
	~PatchElement() behavior?

<li>================ START OF AA:DR AND PR BUGS ================

<li>148 - Handle default menu shortcut values in MovementPrefs.cpp. Should 
	probably move default shortcut values from MovementKeyEditor.cpp. Note:
	prefs now rely on a particular menu's existance. Problem is, it doesn't
	really exist. Possible solution: use the DocWindow's movement menu, not
	some non-existent KMApp menu.

<li>169 - Reinstate clipboard cut/copy/paste.

<li>170 - Reinstate movement keys editor.

<li>172 - Add last-seen-dir pref.

<li>173 - Pasting doesn't work. Copy song from all songs list and try to paste it
	into a chain.

<li>174 - Replace my_find_instantiation_func() and my_instantiate_object() with
	the real thing.

<li>175 - Use BRefFilter to find KM files and HTML files.

<li>177 - Fix up about box icons: do some antialiasing.

<li>185 - Movement menu pref shortcuts need to be shoved in to each movement 
	menu, but when? At mainMenuBeginning() time? Probably too often.
	Perhaps, after changing shortcut prefs, step through each registered
	window, looking for movement menu and updating shortcuts then.

<li>200 - Need way to use MIDI file as input. Instrument "port"? Trigger?
	If trigger, then triggers must be inputs as well as outputs.

<li>204 - Select multiple songs in all songs window. Delete. Crash.

<li>205 - ListBox doesn't yet handle multiple selections for all commands.

<li>208 - Make Trigger send MIDI messages. NOTE: this would obviate the need for
	patch entry/exit messages. Probably don't want to get rid of them,
	though.

<li>217 - AllSongWindow: If any chain is open with a song in it when you delete
	a song, that window will not be updated.

<li>218 - Code in AllSongBox to make first song current does not work. [This
	*is* necessary after use deletes all songs then creates a new one.]

<li>220 - Playing sounds in TriggerSoundFile is not implemented.

<li>222 - Make new message. Open editor. Edit message name. Message name not
	updated in open list-of-messages window. (Works for other list windows
	like instruments window). Perhaps notify list window during
	putValuesIntoFields(), but how get handle to list window?

<li>224 - When delete last song in all songs, the doc window is not updated
	to not-show-any-song.

<li>230 - Separate instruments into separate help page from edit.html.

<li>231 - When close trigger editor then re-open, views not populated with
	correct values. Perhaps put code in view creation routines (if type
	of trigger/action is correct).

<li>232 - In trigger editor, if anything but "patch" is selected, don't
	display song and patch text items.

<li>233 - Drag midi input. Delete output. Replace output with trigger.
	(Do something?) Quit app. Patch window hangs, and is empty. Probably
	related problem: do same but close patch window (and editors) before
	quitting app. App hangs.
