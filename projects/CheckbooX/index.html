<p><b>CheckbooX</b> is a Mac OS X application that mimics the register
included with your checkbook. It comes complete with source code. It's the
application I used as an example in my article <a
href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/04/23/ocunit.html">Unit
Testing with OCUnit</a>, published on O'Reilly's <a
href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/">MacDevCenter</a> on April 23, 2004.</p>

<p>Since I've just released CheckbooX for the first time, there's not much
more to say. Please see the file <a href="CheckbooX%20Readme.rtf">CheckbooX
Readme.rtf</a>; it is also included with the application.</p>
