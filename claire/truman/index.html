        <p>I believe that, taking into account the circumstances under which
        he became president, Harry Truman excelled as a leader who brought
        peace to the United States and Europe while keeping the American
        economy stable.</p>

        <h2 id="becpres">Becoming President</h2>

        <p>

          Harry Truman assumed the role of president within an unprecedented
          and very challenging set of circumstances. Truman, who originally
          served as Franklin Roosevelt’s vice president, was forced to
          assume the role of army chief upon Roosevelt’s untimely death only
          weeks after beginning his fourth and final term. Harry Truman
          never had any intention of running for president or taking on such
          an important role, but was sworn into office as soon as Roosevelt
          died. In a matter of days, Harry Truman had become the most
          important and influential man in America. Truman was given no time
          to prepare for his new position as president, and was not aware of
          many top secret projects going on at the time of his inauguration,
          including the development of the atomic bomb.
        </p>

        <h2 id="atombomb">The Atomic Bomb</h2>

        <p>

          The dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan remains a highly
          controversial topic today. One could spend years pondering whether
          or not to make the decision to kill thousands in order to protect
          the lives of millions more. However, Truman only had three months
          to decide whether to drop the first bomb on Hiroshima. As vice
          president, Truman had been unaware of the development of the
          atomic bomb, and was only told of the project after it was put
          under his control when he became president. After almost no time,
          Truman was forced to make a decision that altered all of history.
          On August 6, 1945, Truman gave the order to drop the first bomb
          over Hiroshima, which he then announced to the American people
          twelve hours later. In his speech, Truman advocated the dropping
          of the bomb, saying it was the right thing to do. Truman said:
        </p>

        <blockquote>We are now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and
        completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have above
        ground in any city. We shall destroy their docks, their factories,
        and their communications. Let there be no mistake; we shall
        completely destroy Japan's power to make war.</blockquote>

        <p>It was to spare the Japanese people from utter destruction that
        the ultimatum of July 26 was issued at Potsdam. Their leaders
        promptly rejected that ultimatum. If they do not now accept our
        terms they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which
        has never been seen on this earth.</p>


        <p>Truman was consistent in his defense of the decision to drop the
        bomb. This can be observed in a letter Truman wrote to his friend:
        “…it was done to save 125,000 youngsters on the American side and
        125,000 on the Japanese side from getting killed and that is what it
        did. It probably also saved a half million youngsters on both sides
        from being maimed for life.” It is true that, in the short term, the
        effects of the atomic bomb were horrific. Hundreds of thousands were
        killed, and thousands more injured and left to die in awful ways.
        However, the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima - and later on,
        Nagasaki - did cause Japan to surrender to America. In the long run,
        the bombings ultimately did save more lives than they took.</p>

        <h2 id="economy">America's Economy</h2>

        <p>
          <img src="images/fairdeal.jpg" class="pimg1"/>
          While WWII was still in progress, America’s economy boomed.
          Thousands of new jobs were created in the manufacturing of
          weapons, and women became more accepted in the workforce. During
          this time, Truman introduced his 21-point policy, called the Fair
          Deal. This policy addressed many important issues in America at
          the time, such as the rights of workers and aiding the educational
          system. Many of the points Truman proposed were considered
          liberal, in that they sought to aid small businesses and veterans.
          The Fair Deal, however, is mostly known for its proposed
          employment reforms. The Fair Deal, in trying to deal with
          unemployment compensation, tried to make the Fair Employment
          Practice Committee (which was also intended to address civil
          rights issues) permanent. Unfortunately, only a portion of the
          Fair Deal made it through Congress. Both national health insurance
          and educational assistance measures were voted down. Today,
          Truman’s Fair Deal policy is considered a mixed success. While
          some aspects of it thrived, such as the housing program and the
          expansion of social security, a government program people still
          use today, others did not succeed.
        </p>

        <h2 id="civilrights">Civil Rights</h2>

        <p>
          <img src="images/civil_rights.jpg" class="pimg1"/>
          But even when Truman did not fully succeed, his failures were
        easily drowned out by his other impressive accomplishments. Truman
        tapped into subjects other presidents did not, the biggest being
        civil rights. Truman sought to protect African Americans by law. He
        especially wanted to make lynching illegal and create a Civil Rights
        branch of the Department of Justice. Truman wanted to help other
        marginalized groups as well, such as women in the workforce. Truman
        tried to solve some of these inequalities through multiple points in
        his Fair Deal policy. In a speech given in 1948, Truman listed ten
        of his objectives to improve civil rights in America:</p>

        <blockquote>We believe that all men are created equal and that they
        have the right to equal justice under law. We believe that all men
        have the right to freedom of thought and of expression and the right
        to worship as they please. We believe that all men are entitled to
        equal opportunities for jobs, for homes, for good health and for
        education. We believe that all men should have a voice in their
        government and that government should protect, not usurp, the rights
        of the people. These are the basic civil rights, which are the
        source and the support of our democracy.</blockquote>

        <p>Unfortunately, many people disagreed with Truman’s views.
        Truman’s approval ratings went down, and few members of the white
        population supported his objectives. Despite this, Truman did keep
        his word. Before he left office, changes were made to America’s
        civil rights policies. In July of 1948, racial discrimination was
        officially banned from federal government hiring practices, and
        Truman ordered an end to military segregation. Truman’s advocacy of
        civil rights helped to spark the civil rights movement that was
        later to come. Over the next sixty years, America’s views on civil
        rights and equality dramatically changed, and the actions Truman
        took as president had much to do with this. </p>

        <h2 id="foraff">Foreign Affairs</h2>

        <p>
          <img src="images/nato.jpg" class="pimg1"/>
          Beyond being successful in leading America, Truman was also
        regarded as extremely successful in foreign affairs. One of the most
        famous foreign policies Truman is known for is NATO (National
        Atlantic Treaty Organization). This was a peacetime military
        alliance that sought to maintain peace among nations. The members
        who signed NATO’s treaty agreed to help to protect all other nations
        involved. An attack against one of the allied nations would be
        considered an attack against all nations that were parties to the
        treaty. The original twelve nations to sign the treaty were Great
        Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,
        Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, Canada, and the United States.
        America signed the treaty in 1949, hoping it could help to counter
        the U.S.S.R.’s military power. </p>

        <p>Truman also worked on pre-existing foreign policies, such as the
        National Security Team he inherited from Roosevelt. As leader of the
        National Security Team (NST), Truman’s job was to handle the
        negotiations at the post-war conferences of allied foreign
        ministers. Throughout Truman’s presidency, he fired and brought
        several leaders of the NST into place. Truman first replaced FDR's
        last secretary of state, Edward Stettinius, with former senator,
        Supreme Court justice and war mobilization director James F. Byrnes,
        who was later replaced with Gen. George C. Marshall. In 1947, the
        NST passed the National Security Act, reorganizing the military.
        This act brought together the Department of War and the Department
        of the Navy, turning them into the National Military Establishment,
        which was to be headed by the Secretary of Defense. The NST is also
        responsible for the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency
        (CIA) in 1947. The CIA is meant to gather intelligence about foreign
        affairs, including facts regarding governments, corporations, and
        persons. The NST, in addition, established the National Security
        Council (NSC) to advise the president about issues related to
        American foreign policy, and this council became powerful during the
        Korean War. Overall, the NST was a great success, creating important
        organizations and policies that are still with us today.</p>

        <p>

          After World War II, much of Europe was left in ruins. Because of
        this, both the United States and Soviet Union were scrambling to
        gain influence over the weakened areas. America was committed to
        halting the spread of communism, so Truman created the Marshall
        Plan. The Marshall Plan was meant to aid in the reconstruction of
        Europe after the war. Overall, America spent over $13 billion
        rebuilding other countries under the terms of the Marshall Plan.
        Truman also took action to stop the spread of the Soviet Union’s
        influence by enacting the Truman Doctrine, which was introduced to
        prevent the spread of communism. This battle for dominance between
        the United States and the Soviet Union was one of the leading
        factors in the beginning of the Cold War. Truman hoped to maintain
        peace with the Soviet Union through negotiations and compromise.
        Unfortunately, nothing could subdue the rivalry, and the Cold War
        ended up lasting from 1947 to 1991, long past Truman’s
        presidency.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

        <p>To this day, many people believe Truman to be one of the five
        greatest presidents in America’s history. He accomplished a great
        amount within a very short period of time. It is true that not all
        of his proposals were accepted and not all his policies went into
        effect, but every reform he tried to undertake has left a mark on
        America. When I think about what it truly means to be an American I
        look to Harry Truman - a true patriot who fought for the freedom,
        stability, and equality of his country and its citizens.</p>
