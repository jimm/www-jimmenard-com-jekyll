# Music

My first piano lesson was the day before my fifth birthday. In the past, I
often combined computers and music, like my now-defunct live performance
software <a href="projects/keymaster/index.html">KeyMaster</a>, originally
written on the Commodore 64, ported to the Atari ST, and redesigned for the
now-defunct [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS). I've worked a bit on
a new version for Mac OS X, but it's nowhere near usable.

The MIDI reference has moved [here](midi_ref.html). It's not a tutorial.
Rather, it is intended as a quick overview and a reference guide.

I performed in [bands](#band-list) from 1980 to 1993, and started playing
out with a band again in 2013. Everything from progressive rock to dance pop
to electric jazz; covers and originals. Here's a video of
[Miles at Connelly's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5yU0mX-u4w) in Times
Square, New York City in 2013. I'm the guy with the beard and glasses stuck
to the side of the stage.

I write different kinds of stuff. Most of it is funk/dance/pop, but I also
dabble in orchestral, Sondheim-esque pieces, game show themes, thirty-second
newsroom background music, and whatever else tickles my fancy.

Perhaps some day I'll post some snippets of my music. Aside from the typeset
pieces below and the sequencer and MIDI files of the music I've done on my
own, I only have one crappy cassette of a bunch of works-in-progress from
the late '80s. It's dated but good stuff. The sound quality is horrendous.
Also, the tape broke so I'll need to repair it one day.

# Compositions

Here are three pieces I composed that I've typeset using
[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/).

- [Equal Rites Main Theme](music/main_theme_piano.pdf)
- [Equal Rites Number 3](music/equal_rites_3.pdf)
- [Mosquito Bite Rag](music/mosquito_bite_rag.pdf)


# Equipment Collection

Here's a tech-head's view of the tools I use to create my music.

## Equipment List

- Korg Kronos X 88

- Kurzweil Midiboard

- Korg Wavestation

- A big honking seven-foot rack, affectionately called the "Think Tank. Most
  of the equipment in it was originally mounted in a homemade, rolling,
  chest-high rack along with a Commodore 64 running my own real time
  [MIDI performance software](projects/keymaster/index.html).
  [PatchMaster](http://patchmaster.org/) is the current incarnation of that
  software. It runs on Mac OSX, Linux, Windows, and on the
  [JVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine).
  - Kurzweil K2000RS (R = rackmount, S = sampling)
  - Kurzweil 1000PX
  - Mackie LM-3204 mixer
  - Yamaha MV802 mixer
  - Emagic AMT8 MIDI interface
  - Korg DRV-2000 digital reverb
  - Crest Audio FA901 power amp
  - Two rack-mount power strips
  - Custom patch bay with 12 1/2", 6 MIDI, 4 XLR, 2 1/2" TRS
  - Akai ME10D MIDI "digital delay" (echoes MIDI data, optionally
    transposing it up/down one octave)

- Chapman Stick, 12-string Grand Stick&mdash;5 bass, 7 treble, classic
  tuning (I'm finally getting serious about learning to play it.)

- Moog Etherwave Theremin

- Ibanez SR505 5-string bass

- Fender Stratocaster with one humbucker and two single-coil pickups

- Yamaha U3 upright piano, but it's in the living room along with the
  ukelele, mandolin, and recorders but far away from all the electronic
  gear

- Apple MacBook Pro laptop

- Guitar/Bass Amps:
  - Line 6 LowDown LD400 Pro (2x10")
  - Fender Frontman 15R practice amp that I found at the town dump in
    full working condition

- Speakers:
  - A pair of M-Audio AV 40 monitors
  - JBL EON 515XT powered speaker
  - OAP T-122B wedge (70 lbs, a pain to carry around)
  - Home-made (by someone else) piece of crap

- Three empty six-space racks from the olden days of live
    performance

## Software List

- I wrote my own real-time performance program called
  [KeyMaster](projects/keymaster/index.html) that I used live from
  1986&ndash;1993. Its first incarnation was on a Commodore 64, later ported
  to the Atari ST. I half-heartedly started a Macintosh version. The next
  was the BeOS version. For the latest instantiations see the cross-platform
  [PatchMaster](http://www.patchmaster.org/) and
  [KeyMaster](http://jimm.github.io/keymaster/), a Mac OS X-only simpler
  version that is more responsive.

- [Korg KRONOS Editor](https://shop.korg.com/kronosSupport)
  (link is to the KRONOS support/downloads page)

- [REAPER](http://reaper.fm/) Digital Audio Workstation

- [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/) for music notation typesetting.

- [Overtone](http://overtone.github.com/) for SuperCollider-based synthesis
   via [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)

- [Tracktion 3](http://www.mackie.com/products/tracktion3/index.html), which
  I don't use any more

This is not a complete list of all the music software I have. Since
switching to Mac OS X, I've downloaded a number of utilities such as
MidiPipe, though I don't use them much.
