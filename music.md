# Music

My first piano lesson was the day before my fifth birthday. I often combined
computers and music, like in my live performance
software [PatchMaster](https://patchmaster.org/)
and [SeaMaster](https://github.com/jimm/seamaster). Both stem from an older
program I wrote called KeyMaster I originally wrote on the Commodore 64 and
used on stage for years. I later ported it to the Atari ST and rewrote for
the now-defunct [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS).

My MIDI reference has moved [here](midi_ref.html). It's not a tutorial.
Rather, it is intended as a quick overview and a reference guide.

Currently, I play keyboards in [Ellis Island](http://ellisislandrock.com/).

I performed in [bands](#band-list) from 1980 to 1993, and started playing
out with a band again in 2013. Everything from progressive rock to dance pop
to electric jazz; covers and originals. Here's a video of
[Miles at Connelly's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5yU0mX-u4w) in Times
Square, New York City in 2013. I'm the guy with the beard and glasses stuck
to the side of the stage. There's also another group of us that gets
together every week or two to jam and learn songs from the '70's - today
that we like and can put our own spin on.

I write different kinds of stuff. Most of it is funk/dance/pop, but I also
dabble in orchestral, Sondheim-esque pieces, game show themes, thirty-second
newsroom background music, and whatever else tickles my fancy.

Perhaps some day I'll post some snippets of my music. Aside from the typeset
pieces below and the sequencer and MIDI files of the music I've done on my
own, I only have one crappy cassette of a bunch of works-in-progress from
the late '80s. It's dated but good stuff. The sound quality is horrendous.
Also, the tape broke so I'll need to repair it one day.

# Compositions

Here are three pieces I composed that I've typeset using
[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/).

- [Equal Rites Main Theme](music/main_theme_piano.pdf)
- [Equal Rites Number 3](music/equal_rites_3.pdf)
  - Recording is called [At Sea](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/at-sea)
    on Soundcloud
- [Mosquito Bite Rag](music/mosquito_bite_rag.pdf)

Here are a few others on SoundCloud:

- [Delicate](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/delicate) from Equal Rites
- [No Fences](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/no-fences-draft) (draft)
- [Solar Power](https://soundcloud.com/upload) (draft)

  Most of the equipment in it was originally mounted in a homemade, rolling,
  chest-high rack of the same name, along with a Commodore 64 running my own
  real time MIDI performance software.

## Software List

- [REAPER](http://reaper.fm/) Digital Audio Workstation.

- [KeyMaster](https://github.com/jimm/keymaster/wiki), real-time MIDI
  performance software that I wrote. The first incarnation was also called
  [KeyMaster](projects/keymaster/index.html). I used that version live from
  1986&ndash;1993. It was first written for the Commodore 64, later ported
  to the Atari ST. I half-heartedly started a Macintosh version. The next
  was the BeOS version. For later instantiations see the cross-platform
  [PatchMaster](http://www.patchmaster.org/) and
  [keymaster_objc](http://jimm.github.io/keymaster_objc/), a Mac OS X-only
  simpler version.

- Apple's [MainStage 3](http://www.apple.com/mainstage/) is useful when I
  play with friends. We rent a rehearsal room once a week or so, and though
  the keyboards are the same in the different rooms we rent it is nice to
  have the same sounds, splits, transposes, etc. with me on my laptop.

- [MidiPipe](http://www.subtlesoft.square7.net/MidiPipe.html) MIDI munger.

- [Korg KRONOS Editor](https://shop.korg.com/kronosSupport)
  (link is to the KRONOS support/downloads page).

- [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/) for music notation typesetting.

- [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), a code-based music creation and
  performance tool.

  my KeyMaster software
- Conn trumpet

  powered up. I had the two of mine say "Welcome to the" and "Think Tank!")
