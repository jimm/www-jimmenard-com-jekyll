# Music

My first piano lesson was the day before my fifth birthday. I often combine
computers and music, like in my live performance software
[KeyMaster](https://github.com/jimm/keymaster) and its newer, more modern
sibling [JUCE KeyMaster](https://github.com/jimm/juce-keymaster). These
programs stem from an older program I wrote with the same name that I
originally wrote and ran on the Commodore 64 and used on stage for years. I
later ported it to the Atari ST, rewrote it for the now-defunct
[BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS), and wrote a Ruby version called
[PatchMaster](https://github.com/jimm/patchmaster/).

I play keyboards in [Ellis Island](http://ellisislandrock.com/), a cover
band based in Connecticut. Check out our [Spring 20204 demo
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf8QA3BE5fU).

I've been in [bands](#band-list) from circa 1975 to January 1993, went on a
hiatus, and started playing out again in 2013. Over the years, I've played
everything from progressive rock to dance pop to electric jazz and R&amp;B;
covers and originals.

I write different kinds of stuff. Most of it is funk/dance/pop, but I also
dabble in orchestral styles, Sondheim-esque pieces, game show themes,
thirty-second newsroom background music, and whatever else tickles my fancy.

Aside from the typeset pieces below and the sequencer and MIDI files of the
music I've done on my own, I have thrown a few things up on Soundcloud for
the fun of it --- none of it production quality. Out of all of the original
songs we did in the late '80's, I only have one crappy cassette of a bunch
of works-in-progress. It's dated but really good stuff. The sound quality
is horrendous. Also, the tape broke so I'll need to repair it one day and
digitize it.

My MIDI reference has moved [here](midi_ref.html). It's not a tutorial.
Rather, it is intended as a quick overview and a reference guide.

# Compositions

Here are three pieces I composed that I've typeset using
[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/).

- [Equal Rites Main Theme](music/main_theme_piano.pdf)
- [Equal Rites Number 3](music/equal_rites_3.pdf)
  - Recording is called [At Sea](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/at-sea)
    on Soundcloud
- [Mosquito Bite Rag](music/mosquito_bite_rag.pdf)

Here are a few of the other songs on my
[SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard):

- [Delicate](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/delicate) from Equal Rites
- [No Fences](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/no-fences-draft) (draft)
- [Solar Power](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/solar-power) (draft)

# Equipment Collection

Here's what my home "studio" looks like in 2023. Since then, the Iridium has
been sold. When I play live I take the Kronos and the Hydrasynth.

  Most of the equipment in it was originally mounted in a homemade, rolling,
  chest-high rack of the same name, along with a Commodore 64 running my own
  real time MIDI performance software.
  - Kurzweil K2000RS (R = rackmount, S = sampling), the rackmount version of
    [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurzweil_K2000)

## Live Rig

Here's what I use when I play live with [Ellis
Island](https://ellisislandrock.com/). Everything here is from the above
equipment list. You can see it in action
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN8Sgid2x30), though that video was
made before I started hooking up the synths with MIDI.

- Korg Kronos, sustain pedal, expression pedal used for volume, switch used
  for Leslie simulation speed
- ASM Hydrasynth Deluxe, sustain pedal, expression pedal (optional)
- On-Stage stand for the keyboards
- Fender Stratocaster
- Audio
  - Line 6 XH Stomp XL for the strat
  - Key Largo mixer providing stereo XLR or 1/4" to the house
  - MEE Audio MX2 in-ear monitors (IEM)
  - Xvive U4 in-ear wireless system
- MIDI
  - iPad using an Apple Camera (USB data to Thunderbolt) adapter to connect
    to a USB hub or a cable (see the next item)
  - One of these, depending on my mood
    - All USB (default)
      - USB cables from the Kronos and the Hydrasynth USB B outputs into the hub
      - Hub plugs into the iPad; iPad acts as the hub host
    - 5-pin DIN between synths, USB from iPad to Kronos to send prog
      changes. This is a backup in case the iPad dies
  - The iPad is running [Midiflow](https://www.midiflow.com/) and
    [BandHelper](https://bandhelper.com/)
    - Midiflow routes the MIDI between the Kronos and the Hydrasynth when
      I'm using the USB hub. I also use it to filter out clock messages in
      both directions and and modify the velocity curve when going from the
      Hydrasynth to the Kronos
    - BandHelper sends MIDI program changes to the Kronos which is in set list
      mode
    - I have the Kronos combinations for each song send program changes to
      the Hydrasynth and the HX Stomp XL when needed
- Optional / Rare
  - Ibanez bass (only for the few gigs where I've had to sub for the bass
    player)
  - Line 6 amp for the bass

I've dabbled with WIDI (Bluetooth MIDI) but had some latency problems that
must be caused by the way I was routing things. If I just set up WIDI
between the two synths everything works fine, but when I introduce the iPad
with Midiflow and BandHelper, there's a delay when I use the Hydrasynth to
play the Kronos. So I don't do that.

## Software List

- [BandHelper](https://bandhelper.com/).

- [Midiflow](https://www.midiflow.com/) for the iPad.

- [REAPER](http://reaper.fm/) Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).

- [KeyMaster](https://github.com/jimm/keymaster/wiki), real-time MIDI
  performance software that I wrote. The first incarnation was also called
  [KeyMaster](projects/keymaster/index.html). I used that version live from
  1986&ndash;1993. It was first written for the Commodore 64, later ported
  to the Atari ST. I half-heartedly started a Macintosh version. The next
  was the BeOS version, then a Ruby version
  ([PatchMaster](https://github.com/jimm/patchmaster/)), next
  [keymaster_objc](http://jimm.github.io/keymaster_objc/), a Mac OS X-only
  simpler version, and finally the cross-platform GUI version written in C++
  using wxWidgets ([KeyMaster](https://github.com/jimm/keymaster/wiki)).
  
- [Kronut](https://github.com/jimm/kronut), a set list slot text editor for
  the Kronos. It's software I wrote that lets me use my editor (Emacs) to
  edit single set list slot descriptions and entire set lists.

- ASM's Hydrasynth Patch Manager and Firmware Updater
  ([download page](https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/downloads))

- [Korg KRONOS Editor](https://shop.korg.com/kronosSupport)
  (link is to the KRONOS support/downloads page). I've had troubles using
  this editor; the design it uses for edit space / memory is extremely
  confusing and I've more often erased / ruined set lists than successfully
  edited them.

- Apple's [MainStage 3](http://www.apple.com/mainstage/) was useful when I
  play with friends. We used to rent a rehearsal room once a week or so, and
  though the keyboards are the same in the different rooms we rent it was
  nice to have the same sounds, splits, transposes, etc. with me on my
  laptop.

- [MidiPipe](http://www.subtlesoft.square7.net/MidiPipe.html) MIDI munger.

- [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/) for music notation typesetting.
