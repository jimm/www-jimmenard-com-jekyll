# Music

My first piano lesson was the day before my fifth birthday. I often combined
computers and music, like in my live performance
software [PatchMaster](https://patchmaster.org/)
and [SeaMaster](https://github.com/jimm/seamaster). Both stem from an older
program I wrote called KeyMaster I originally wrote on the Commodore 64 and
used on stage for years. I later ported it to the Atari ST and rewrote for
the now-defunct [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS).

My MIDI reference has moved [here](midi_ref.html). It's not a tutorial.
Rather, it is intended as a quick overview and a reference guide.

I performed in [bands](#band-list) from 1980 to 1993, and started playing
out with a band again in 2013. Everything from progressive rock to dance pop
to electric jazz; covers and originals. Here's a video of
[Miles at Connelly's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5yU0mX-u4w) in Times
Square, New York City in 2013. I'm the guy with the beard and glasses stuck
to the side of the stage. There's also another group of us that gets
together every week or two to jam and learn songs from the '70's - today
that we like and can put our own spin on.

I write different kinds of stuff. Most of it is funk/dance/pop, but I also
dabble in orchestral, Sondheim-esque pieces, game show themes, thirty-second
newsroom background music, and whatever else tickles my fancy.

Perhaps some day I'll post some snippets of my music. Aside from the typeset
pieces below and the sequencer and MIDI files of the music I've done on my
own, I only have one crappy cassette of a bunch of works-in-progress from
the late '80s. It's dated but good stuff. The sound quality is horrendous.
Also, the tape broke so I'll need to repair it one day.

# Compositions

Here are three pieces I composed that I've typeset using
[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/).

- [Equal Rites Main Theme](music/main_theme_piano.pdf)
- [Equal Rites Number 3](music/equal_rites_3.pdf)
- [Mosquito Bite Rag](music/mosquito_bite_rag.pdf)

# Equipment Collection

Here's a tech-head's view of the tools I use to create my music.

## Equipment List

- Korg Kronos X 88

- Studiologic Sledge 2.0

- Kurzweil Midiboard

- Korg Wavestation

- A big honking seven-foot rack, affectionately called the "Think Tank".
  Most of the equipment in it was originally mounted in a homemade, rolling,
  chest-high rack along with a Commodore 64 running my own real
  time
  [MIDI performance software](projects/keymaster/index.html).
  [PatchMaster](http://patchmaster.org/) is the current incarnation of that
  software. It runs on Mac OSX, Linux, Windows, and on
  the [JVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine).
  - Kurzweil K2000RS (R = rackmount, S = sampling)
  - Kurzweil 1000PX
  - Mackie LM-3204 mixer
  - Yamaha MV802 mixer
  - Emagic AMT8 MIDI interface
  - Korg DRV-2000 digital reverb
  - Crest Audio FA901 power amp
  - Two rack-mount power strips
  - Custom patch bay with 12 1/2", 6 MIDI, 4 XLR, 2 1/2" TRS
  - Akai ME10D MIDI "digital delay" (echoes MIDI data, optionally
    transposing it up/down one octave)

- On-Stage KS7365EJ Pro Heavy-Duty Folding-Z Keyboard

- Various Ultimate keyboard stands, an Ultimate speaker stand

- Chapman Stick, 12-string Grand Stick&mdash;5 bass, 7 treble, classic
  tuning (I'm finally getting serious about learning to play it.)

- Moog Etherwave Theremin

- Ibanez SR505 5-string bass

- Fender Stratocaster with one humbucker and two single-coil pickups

- Akai MPD 32 USB/MIDI pad controller

- Yamaha U3 upright piano, but it's in the living room along with the
  ukelele, mandolin, and recorders but far away from all the electronic
  gear

- Apple MacBook Pro laptop

- Guitar/Bass Amps:
  - Line 6 LowDown LD400 Pro (2x10")
  - Fender Frontman 15R practice amp that I found at the town dump in
    full working condition

- Speakers:
  - A pair of M-Audio AV 40 monitors
  - JBL EON 515XT powered speaker
  - OAP T-122B wedge (70 lbs, a pain to carry around)
  - Home-made (by someone else) piece of crap

- Three empty six-space racks from the olden days of live performance

## Software List

- I wrote my own real-time performance program called
  [KeyMaster](projects/keymaster/index.html) that I used live from
  1986&ndash;1993. Its first incarnation was on a Commodore 64, later ported
  to the Atari ST. I half-heartedly started a Macintosh version. The next
  was the BeOS version. For the latest instantiations see the cross-platform
  [PatchMaster](http://www.patchmaster.org/) and
  [KeyMaster](http://jimm.github.io/keymaster/), a Mac OS X-only simpler
  version that is more responsive. There's also the newest incarnation,
  [SeaMaster](https://github.com/jimm/seamaster), a version of PatchMaster
  written in C and using the PortMidi library.

- Apple's [MainStage 3](http://www.apple.com/mainstage/) is useful when I
  play with friends. We rent a rehearsal room once a week or so, and though
  the keyboards are the same in the different rooms we rent it is nice to
  have the same sounds, splits, transposes, etc. with me on my laptop.

- [Korg KRONOS Editor](https://shop.korg.com/kronosSupport)
  (link is to the KRONOS support/downloads page).

- [REAPER](http://reaper.fm/) Digital Audio Workstation.

- [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/) for music notation typesetting.

- [Overtone](http://overtone.github.com/) for SuperCollider-based synthesis
   via [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).

- [Tracktion 3](http://www.mackie.com/products/tracktion3/index.html), which
  I don't use any more.

This is not a complete list of all the music software I have. Since
switching to Mac OS X, I've downloaded a number of utilities such as
MidiPipe and SimpleSynth for testing MIDI apps I write.

## Old Gear

Just for fun, here's a list of my old gear. I can't remember everything I've

- Yamaha CS-5
- Alesis D4 drum synth

- Roland Jupiter-6
- Korg CX3 organ

- Kurzweil 2000
- Fender Rhodes
- Yamaha CP 70 electric grand (it was the singer's, but I got to use it)
- Opcode Studio 5 MIDI interface
- Roland Axis strap-on MIDI keyboard
