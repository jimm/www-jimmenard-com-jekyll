# Music

My first piano lesson was the day before my fifth birthday. I often combined
computers and music, like in my live performance software
[KeyMaster](https://github.com/jimm/keymaster). That program stems from an
older program I wrote called KeyMaster that I originally wrote on the
Commodore 64 and used on stage for years. I later ported it to the Atari ST
and rewrote it for the now-defunct
[BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS).

Currently, I play keyboards in [Ellis Island](http://ellisislandrock.com/).

I performed in [bands](#band-list) from 1980 to 1993, went on a hiatus, and
started playing out again in 2013. Over the years, I've played everything
from progressive rock to dance pop to electric jazz and R&amp;B; covers and
originals. Here's a video of
[Miles at Connelly's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5yU0mX-u4w) in Times
Square, New York City in 2013. I'm the guy with the beard and glasses off
at the side of the stage.

I write different kinds of stuff. Most of it is funk/dance/pop, but I also
dabble in orchestral, Sondheim-esque pieces, game show themes, thirty-second
newsroom background music, and whatever else tickles my fancy.

Aside from the typeset pieces below and the sequencer and MIDI files of the
music I've done on my own, I have thrown a few things up on Soundcloud for
the fun of it. Out of all of the original songs we did in the late '80's, I
only have one crappy cassette of a bunch of works-in-progress . It's dated
but really good stuff. The sound quality is horrendous. Also, the tape broke
so I'll need to repair it one day.

My MIDI reference has moved [here](midi_ref.html). It's not a tutorial.
Rather, it is intended as a quick overview and a reference guide.

# Compositions

Here are three pieces I composed that I've typeset using
[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/).

- [Equal Rites Main Theme](music/main_theme_piano.pdf)
- [Equal Rites Number 3](music/equal_rites_3.pdf)
  - Recording is called [At Sea](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/at-sea)
    on Soundcloud
- [Mosquito Bite Rag](music/mosquito_bite_rag.pdf)

Here are a few others on SoundCloud:

- [Delicate](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/delicate) from Equal Rites
- [No Fences](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/no-fences-draft) (draft)
- [Solar Power](https://soundcloud.com/upload) (draft)

# Equipment Collection

Here's what my home "studio" looked like in late 2020. The Midiboard has
since moved on to another home and I've added the Alesis SR18.

## Equipment List

Here's a tech-head's view of the tools I use to create my music.

- [Korg Wavestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korg_Wavestation)
- A big honking seven-foot rack, affectionately called the "Think Tank".
  Most of the equipment in it was originally mounted in a homemade, rolling,
  chest-high rack of the same name, along with a Commodore 64 running my own
  real time MIDI performance software.
  - Kurzweil K2000RS (R = rackmount, S = sampling), the rackmount version of
    [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurzweil_K2000)
  - [Kurzweil 1000PX](https://soundprogramming.net/synthesizers/kurzweil/kurzweil-1000px-professional-expander/)

    transposing it up/down one octave)

  so it's in a two-space rack gig bag.

- [Chapman Stick](http://stick.com/), 12-string Grand Stick with 5 bass, 7
  treble strings; classic tuning

  - Home-made (by someone else) piece of crap
- Guitar/Bass Amps:
  - Line 6 LowDown LD400 Pro (2x10")
  - Fender Frontman 15R practice amp that I found at the town dump in
    full working condition

- Also hanging around
  - Ukelele

## Live Setup

Here's what I use when I play live with [Ellis Island](https://ellisislandrock.com/).
Everything here is from the above equipment list.

- Kronos
- Hydrasynth
- On-Stage stand
- MV802 mixer
- JBL powered speaker
- SR18 (when two of us play small gigs only, not with the full band)
- Ibanez bass (only for the few gigs where I've had to sub for the bass
  player)

## Software List

- [REAPER](http://reaper.fm/) Digital Audio Workstation.

- [KeyMaster](https://github.com/jimm/keymaster/wiki), real-time MIDI
  performance software that I wrote. The first incarnation was also called
  [KeyMaster](projects/keymaster/index.html). I used that version live from
  1986&ndash;1993. It was first written for the Commodore 64, later ported
  to the Atari ST. I half-heartedly started a Macintosh version. The next
  was the BeOS version. For later instantiations see the cross-platform
  [PatchMaster](http://www.patchmaster.org/) and
  [keymaster_objc](http://jimm.github.io/keymaster_objc/), a Mac OS X-only
  simpler version.

- ASM's Hydrasynth Patch Manager and Firmware Updater
  ([download page](https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/downloads))

- [MidiPipe](http://www.subtlesoft.square7.net/MidiPipe.html) MIDI munger.
  
- [Kronut](https://github.com/jimm/kronut), a set list slot text editor for
  the Kronos. It's software I wrote that lets me use my editor (Emacs) to
  edit set list slot titles and notes text.

- [Korg KRONOS Editor](https://shop.korg.com/kronosSupport)
  (link is to the KRONOS support/downloads page). I've had troubles using
  this editor; the design it uses for edit space / memory is extremely
  confusing and I've more often erased / ruined set lists than successfully
  edited them.

- Apple's [MainStage 3](http://www.apple.com/mainstage/) is useful when I
  play with friends. We rent a rehearsal room once a week or so, and though
  the keyboards are the same in the different rooms we rent it is nice to
  have the same sounds, splits, transposes, etc. with me on my laptop.

- [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/) for music notation typesetting.

- [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), a code-based music creation and
  performance tool.
