# Music

My first piano lesson was the day before my fifth birthday. I often combine
computers and music, like in my live performance software
[KeyMaster](https://github.com/jimm/keymaster). That program stems from an
older program I wrote with the same name that I originally wrote on the
Commodore 64 and used on stage for years. I later ported it to the Atari ST,
rewrote it for the now-defunct [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS),
and wrote a Ruby version called
[PatchMaster](https://github.com/jimm/patchmaster/).

Currently, I play keyboards in [Ellis Island](http://ellisislandrock.com/).
We made a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN8Sgid2x30) in 2022.
Check it out!

I performed in [bands](#band-list) from 1980 to January 1993, went on a
hiatus, and started playing out again in 2013. Over the years, I've played
everything from progressive rock to dance pop to electric jazz and R&amp;B;
covers and originals.

I write different kinds of stuff. Most of it is funk/dance/pop, but I also
dabble in orchestral, Sondheim-esque pieces, game show themes, thirty-second
newsroom background music, and whatever else tickles my fancy.

Aside from the typeset pieces below and the sequencer and MIDI files of the
music I've done on my own, I have thrown a few things up on Soundcloud for
the fun of it --- none of it production quality. Out of all of the original
songs we did in the late '80's, I only have one crappy cassette of a bunch
of works-in-progress . It's dated but really good stuff. The sound quality
is horrendous. Also, the tape broke so I'll need to repair it one day.

My MIDI reference has moved [here](midi_ref.html). It's not a tutorial.
Rather, it is intended as a quick overview and a reference guide.

# Compositions

Here are three pieces I composed that I've typeset using
[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/).

- [Equal Rites Main Theme](music/main_theme_piano.pdf)
- [Equal Rites Number 3](music/equal_rites_3.pdf)
  - Recording is called [At Sea](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/at-sea)
    on Soundcloud
- [Mosquito Bite Rag](music/mosquito_bite_rag.pdf)

Here are a few of the other songs on my
[SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard):

- [Delicate](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/delicate) from Equal Rites
- [No Fences](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/no-fences-draft) (draft)
- [Solar Power](https://soundcloud.com/jim-menard/solar-power) (draft)

# Equipment Collection

Here's what my home "studio" looks like in 2023. When I play live I take the
Kronos and the Hydrasynth.

    [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurzweil_K2000)

## Live Rig

Here's what I use when I play live with [Ellis
Island](https://ellisislandrock.com/). Everything here is from the above
equipment list. You can see it in action
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN8Sgid2x30), though that video was
made before I started hooking up the synths with MIDI.

- Korg Kronos
- ASM Hydrasynth Deluxe
- On-Stage stand
- Audio
  - Key Largo mixer providing stereo XLR or 1/4" to the house
  - MEE Audio MX2 in-ear monitors (IEM)
  - Xviv U4 in-ear wireless system
  - ART SPLITMix4 passive splitter/mixer
    - The Key Largo L/R go into this, as does my house monitor send (via
      1/4" or an XLR -> 1/4" adapter)
    - Outputs go to the Xviv IEM send and thus into the IEMs
    - I can also send a separate output to a powered speaker if needed, for
      example during rehearsals for the rest of the band
  - If needed, a monitor or powered speaker on a stand
    - When using a sound system that doesn't have a separate monitor for me,
      I use the Mackie powered speaker sitting atop a mic stand for a
      personal keyboard monitor
    - When I need to project sound out in a small venue with no sound
      system, I use the JBL EON atop an Ultimate speaker stand
  - Xviv U4 in-ear wireless system
- MIDI
  - iPad using an Apple Camera (USB data to Thunderbolt) adapter to connect
    to a USB hub
  - USB cables from the Kronos and the Hydrasynth USB B outputs into the hub
  - The iPad is running [Midiflow](https://www.midiflow.com/) and
    [BandHelper](https://bandhelper.com/)
    - Midiflow routes the MIDI between the Kronos and the Hydrasynth. I also
      use it to filter out clock messages in both directions and and modify
      the velocity curve when going from the Hydrasynth to the Kronos
    - BandHelper sends MIDI program changes to the Kronos which is in set list
      mode
    - I have the Kronos combinations for each song send program changes to
      the Hydrasynth if needed
- Optional / Rare
  - Ibanez bass (only for the few gigs where I've had to sub for the bass
    player)
  - Line 6 amp for the bass

I've dabbled with WIDI (Bluetooth MIDI) but had some latency problems that
have got to be caused by the way I was routing things. If I just set up WIDI
between the two synths everything works fine, but when I introduce the iPad
with Midiflow and BandHelper, there's a delay when I use the Hydrasynth to
play the Kronos. So I don't do that.

## Software List

- [REAPER](http://reaper.fm/) Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).

- [KeyMaster](https://github.com/jimm/keymaster/wiki), real-time MIDI
  performance software that I wrote. The first incarnation was also called
  [KeyMaster](projects/keymaster/index.html). I used that version live from
  1986&ndash;1993. It was first written for the Commodore 64, later ported
  to the Atari ST. I half-heartedly started a Macintosh version. The next
  was the BeOS version, then a Ruby version
  ([PatchMaster](https://github.com/jimm/patchmaster/)), next
  [keymaster_objc](http://jimm.github.io/keymaster_objc/), a Mac OS X-only
  simpler version, and finally the cross-platform GUI version written in C++
  using wxWidgets ([KeyMaster](https://github.com/jimm/keymaster/wiki)).
  
- [Kronut](https://github.com/jimm/kronut), a set list slot text editor for
  the Kronos. It's software I wrote that lets me use my editor (Emacs) to
  edit single set list slot descriptions and entire set lists.

- ASM's Hydrasynth Patch Manager and Firmware Updater
  ([download page](https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/downloads))

- [Korg KRONOS Editor](https://shop.korg.com/kronosSupport)
  (link is to the KRONOS support/downloads page). I've had troubles using
  this editor; the design it uses for edit space / memory is extremely
  confusing and I've more often erased / ruined set lists than successfully
  edited them.

- Apple's [MainStage 3](http://www.apple.com/mainstage/) was useful when I
  play with friends. We used to rent a rehearsal room once a week or so, and
  though the keyboards are the same in the different rooms we rent it was
  nice to have the same sounds, splits, transposes, etc. with me on my
  laptop.

- [MidiPipe](http://www.subtlesoft.square7.net/MidiPipe.html) MIDI munger.

- [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/web/) for music notation typesetting.
