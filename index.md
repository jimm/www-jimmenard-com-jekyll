Welcome to my skein of Web pages, featuring my
[Open Source projects](/projects/), bits of [writing](/writing),
[music composition and performance](music.html), and my
[resume](Jim_Menard_resume.html). If you see something out of date, please
[drop me a line](mailto:jim@jimmenard.com).

I am a programming language maven who enjoys Ruby, Python, Elixir,
Lisp, and many [more languages](/Jim_Menard_resume.html#technical-skills). I have created a
number of Open Source [projects](/projects/) such as the
[midilib](https://github.com/jimm/midilib) Ruby gem,
[KeyMaster](https://github.com/jimm/keymaster) MIDI live performance app,
[CSVLixir](https://github.com/jimm/csvlixir) Elixir library, and
[DataVision](https://github.com/jimm/datavision).

By the way: [Emacs](/emacs_tips.html) is the One True Editor&trade;.
