# Personal

I'm a professional [computer geek](computers.html), an
amateur [musician and composer](music.html), and a full-time husband and
father.

I spend time on a number of Open Source projects
including [PatchMaster](http://patchmaster.org/). For a list, visit
my [projects page](projects/index.html).

I've
written
[<cite>Introduction to Ruby for Mac OS X</cite>](writing/Intro_to_Ruby.html),
the <span class="mag-name">MacTech</span> March 2003 cover article
and
[<cite>Building Applications with Berkeley DB Java Edition</cite>](http://www.sys-con.com/story/?storyid=46235&DE=1),
which appears in the September 2004 issue of
the [Java Developer's Journal](http://www.sys-con.com/java/). I'm also
working on a book on Emacs. For the full list and more on my budding writing
career, see the [writing page](writing/).

<a href="projects/keymaster/index.html"><img src="images/KeyMaster.gif"
alt="KeyMaster" border="0" width="32" height="32" /></a> I'm a computer geek
and a musician. I'm happiest when I can combine the two.

Take a peek at [what I'm doing with music](music.html), what equipment I
use, some samples of my music (coming some day), and
a [MIDI specification reference](midi_ref.html). My main instrument is
keyboards.

# Professional

Here's my [resume](Jim_Menard_resume.html).

I use and enjoy Ruby, Java, Python, Objective-C and Mac OS X, Perl, C++,
Smalltalk, and design and programming in general. Languages I've
experimented with and enjoy include Elixir, Erlang, Clojure, and Haskell.

# Musical

For a while, I was learning to play the
[Chapman Stick](http://www.stick.com/), a ten- or twelve-stringed instrument
that is played by tapping the fretboard with both hands. &quot;For a
while?&quot; Yes; I must confess that I've not touched it (or my
[keyboards](music.html#Equipment)) for months. You've probably heard the
Stick already; it's played in such songs as Peter Gabriel's &quot;Shock The
Monkey&quot; and &quot;I Don't Remember&quot; and Adrian Belew's
&quot;Elephant Talk.&quot; For more on my musical hacking, including some
music clips, take a peek at my [music page](music.html).
